# Footprints Extension
A Chrome extension written for Northwestern IT to extend the functionality of the Footprints IT Service Manager.

## About
This extension provides a number of features that improve the experience of using Footprints.

Primarily, the extension detects your location as Library or Sherman, based on the IP address of your computer. 
If your location cannot be determined, it asks for it on the Footprints login screen. This is saved to Chrome storage,
and the extension then automatically populates the Walk-In Location field when editing tickets.

The extension also applies a more aesthetically pleasing theme to the ticket page and implements some new functionality
such as the "Fixify" button to clean up emails before they are sent and the ability to view image and text attachments by 
hovering over them.

We updated the Northwestern IT splash page ("CONWEB") to include a banner telling consultants to use this. The newest 
version of the extension removes that banner.

Because the labels that we use to categorize our tickets can be difficult to remember, there is now a search box for 
categorizations directly above the Service Family field. 

## Installation
The extension can be installed in Google Chrome on the Chrome Web Store
[here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/footprints-selector/bhcajiiignledggebpaalkpcccbjohhc).
